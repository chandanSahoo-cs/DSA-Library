# Tree

## Differen types of binary trees
 - **Full Binary Tree** : has 0 or 2 children
 - **Complete Binary Tree**:
 	- all levels are completely filled except the last level
 	- the last level has all nodes on as left as possible
 - **Perfect Binary Tree** : all leaf nodes are on same level
 - **Balanced Binary Tree** : height of tree is at max logn
 - **Degenerate Binary Tree** : Every node having one child

 ## Traversal Techniques 
  - **DFS** : 
  	- **Inorder** : left->root->right
  	- **Preorder** : root->left->right
  	- **Postorder** : left->right->root
  - **BFS**
